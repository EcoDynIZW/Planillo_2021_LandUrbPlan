There are three scripts and a source file with the R packages required to run the code.
The scripts load and save data to specific folders that were not included in github due to size limitations.

Scripts:
1_Data_Preparation_Exploration: This script loads, cleans and prepares the data in the correct format for the analysis. It also explores some summaries and information of the raw data.

2_SDMs_Nightingale_Berlin: This script runs the species distribution models for all the datasets and compare the results.

3_Additional_Plots: Here is the code for the figure of the study area.

Additionally, there is a Folder with extra functions to deal with eBird data "R_functions_Johnston", more info in
